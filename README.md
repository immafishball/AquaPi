# AquaPi

Monitor your Aquarium's Temperature and Water Level. With DFRobot Circuit Boards and Probe upgrades, you can also monitor your pH, Dissolved Oxygen, Temperature, Turbidity and other DFRobot circuits and probes. It can also identify types of fish to set conditions of the environment to the selected type of fish.
Powered by an Raspberry Pi and Controlled by IoT. You can set alerts for anything, make automations for auto-top-off, and see beautiful graphs of your aquarium's data (see screenshot).

## Appearance

This app simply made during my college as a final output for Project and Design 2. The UI is fully responsive therefore viewing it on small screens should be fine.
